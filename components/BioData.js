              <br></br>My name is Rhoda, and I am a Junior Full Stack Developer
              from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>My background includes work in Social Services,
              Education, and Customer Service. After some time working in these
              fields, I felt a push for a new challenge, and thankfully found it
              in a field that is growing, can keep me on my toes through
              constant development, and provokes curiosity and creativity.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>Coming from a background that is largely people-based, I
              am always thinking about how my work can improve other's
              experiences. As a Junior Dev, I look to questions of how I can
              make my coding practice more efficient in its readability,
              particularly for peers to build upon and manipulate. I also think
              about the user, and how this quest for coding efficiency bears
              fruit in apps that are scalable, and respond quickly over servers.
              <br></br>

              To end things off on a less formal note, in my spare time I enjoy sewing, a good deadlift, and cat videos ðŸ˜Š
