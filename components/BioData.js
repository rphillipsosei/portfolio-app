                Hi!<br></br><br></br> <i>My name is Rhoda, and I am a Full Stack Developer
                from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</i>
              </b>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>I come from a professional background that includes work
              in Social Services, Education, and Customer Service. After many years
              working between these fields, I felt a push for a new challenge,
              and thankfully found it in an area that is growing, can keep me on
              my toes through constant development, and provokes curiosity and
              creativity.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Being that I am from a largely people-based background, I feel I have a lot to offer. As a Junior Dev, I think to how I can write more efficient code that peers can
              build upon and manipulate. I think to learning what makes more scalable databases, and apps
               run  as quickly and efficiently as possible over servers. That is to say I am always thinking about how my work can improve other's
              experiences. 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              To end things off on a less formal note, in my spare time I enjoy
              sewing, a good deadlift, and cat videos ðŸ˜Š
